It is a simple game.

In this game, the hero is controlled by the index finger, the coordinates of which are read by your camera.
Main idea: in the game itself, you need to dodge the columns flying at your hero.


Before start the game:
  - please adjust the brightness in the room
  - ask other people, except the player, to leave the camera's field of view, so that the program can accurately recognize the player's finger.
